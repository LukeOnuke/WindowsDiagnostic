# WindowsDiagnostic
 An opensource diagnostics program for windows computers. Its in a single file *(less than 300kb)* and depends on system components, so its easly distrabutable. 

It can :
- diagnose problems with computer components automaticly
- display startup tasks
- read important parts of the ManagmentDB for you

Planned
- Export report

I keep it in my pc repair thumb drive.

There is nothing more to say, just a diagnosis program for windows.
